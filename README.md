### 01. Solidity Beginner Programs

[Solidity Beginner Programs](https://github.com/farawaystar/solidity-beginner-programs) : A bunch of beginner programs on solidity with basic to increasing complexity, exercises and solutions that one can implement to get the hang of the language. Damn Interesting stuff. I will expand this library as and when I come across an intersting program that is not a repo of its own.
